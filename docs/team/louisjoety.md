# Project Portfolio Page: ExchangeCourseMapper

By: Joe Tien You (@louisjoety)

## 1. Overview - Code contributed
I played a key role in developing my team's Information Checker feature, specifically the `ObtainContactsCommand` and `ListSchoolsCommand`. I also created the `Command` parent class,
which serves as the backbone of the application, allowing for easy extension to other child classes in line with object-oriented programming (OOP) standards. 
Additionally, I crafted detailed user and developer guides to ensure a smooth experience for both end-users and my team of developers.
